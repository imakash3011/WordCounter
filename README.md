## Description

- This project will help us to scrape any website and count the number of times a particular word
will appear in the file.

## Using 

- Tkinter (for GUI ) : to show the number of times a word is appearing in the file.

- Sqlite3 :  to store the data and handle database related work.

- BeautifulSoup & Request : to scrape the text from the website

- Pandas : to store the data in the form for dataframe to clearly view everything.

- also we are using some other library to make our work easy.


## Working

- Run the program
- After running the program it will ask for database name "Enter the database name"
- After that it will ask for website URL you want to scrape data from paste the URl.
- Now hurrahhhhh.... it we automatically perform the scaping part and we show you the result.
- Now it will again ask you URL you want to scrape again or simply just press 0 to exit.
- If you have Enter URL then all the above steps will be repeated again.
- If you have entered "0" then it will exit the program.
- After exiting the program not it will show you all the data you have and the details 
regarding to that data.
